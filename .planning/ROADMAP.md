# eden-ui-flutter — Roadmap

## Active Objectives

_(none — small fixes are tracked as `/devflow:quick` tasks under `.planning/quick/`. Full objectives accrue when a single capability spans multiple TRDs or needs research/verification ceremony.)_

## v2 Future Objectives

Tracked but not in current scope:

- **VRT-01** — Visual regression baselines for all `eden_*_test.dart` widgets at iPhone-narrow + iPad-portrait + desktop widths. Defer until Eden visual identity stabilizes enough that pixel-diffs aren't constant noise.
- **XPL-01** — Cross-platform render gates in CI for all 6 supported platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux, web).

## Quick Tasks Tracker

See `STATE.md` § "Quick Tasks Completed" + commit log on `main` for shipped fixes. RESP-XX requirements (responsive layout — `EdenPageHeader` iPhone-narrow Wrap fix etc.) are addressed via quick tasks until they accumulate into a broader responsive-design objective.

## Triage Heuristic

| Work shape | Tool |
|---|---|
| Single-line fix, 1 file, <30 LOC | `/devflow:micro` |
| 1-5 files, <200 LOC, no architectural decisions | `/devflow:quick` |
| Multi-file capability with research / verification needs | `/devflow:plan-objective <N>` (full objective) |
| Net-new widget component with design + a11y + tests | `/devflow:plan-objective <N>` |

When in doubt, start with `/devflow:quick`; promote to a full objective only if scope clearly spans it.
